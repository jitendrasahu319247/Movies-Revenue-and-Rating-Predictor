# Movies-Revenue-and-Rating-Predictor
This project focuses on key aspects of data analytics, beginning with data cleaning, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using data visualization techniques to gain insights, and culminating in the development of a predictive model. The model forecasts the revenues and ratings of movies before their release based on these insights.
